# COMP90086 Workshop Solutions

Hey there,

I'm creating this little repo to put my modified workshop material for UniMelb Course [COMP90086 - Computer Vision](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90086). 

Created by Kris Ehinger, major rework done by Jiayang Ao and COMP90086 Teaching Team, where I (Khoi Nguyen) tweaked a little bit in. Have fun!

> Note: If you like it, a star would make me look cool on my GitHub Profile!

> End of sem note: It has been a very great experience teaching you all! It is a pleasure for me to have such awesome students in the class like you, and I kindly thank you all, for gifting me these precious memories that I won't forget.

Keep in touch, and all the best to your journey ahead! - Khoi
